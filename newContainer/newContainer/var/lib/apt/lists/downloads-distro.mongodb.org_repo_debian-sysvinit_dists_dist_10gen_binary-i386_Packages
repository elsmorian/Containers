Description: An object/document-oriented database
 MongoDB is a high-performance, open source, schema-free
 document-oriented  data store that's easy to deploy, manage
 and use. It's network accessible, written in C++ and offers
 the following features :
 .
    * Collection oriented storage - easy storage of object-
      style data
    * Full index support, including on inner objects
    * Query profiling
    * Replication and fail-over support
    * Efficient storage of binary data including large
      objects (e.g. videos)
    * Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability (Q209)
 .
 High performance, scalability, and reasonable depth of
 functionality are the goals for the project.
